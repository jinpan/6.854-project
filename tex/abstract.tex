\noindent Maximum Concurrent Flow (MCF) is used in a wide range of optimization
problems where one needs to send multiple commodities concurrently
across a network to meet a set of demands. In particular, MCF
optimizes the minimum fraction of the how much any one commodity is
satisfied. Here, we implement a fully polynomial approximation scheme
for MCF first introduced by Garg. We summarize the algorithm and
analysis and discuss various heuristics that affect theoretical and
experimental runtime. We offer a novel heuristic based on sloppy $\beta$
scaling that demonstrates better experimental runtime. We then present
an implementation of this algorithm and these heuristics upon a series
of randomly generated graphs to demonstrate the effect that
varying parameters has upon runtime. We conclude that our
implementation is indeed quadratic in the error term, and we observed
that several heuristics offer useful speedups in practice.
