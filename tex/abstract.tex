% Abstract

Maximum Concurrent Flow (MCF) is used in a wide range of optimization problems where one needs to send multiple
commodities concurrently across a network to meet a set of demands. In particular, MCF optimizes the minimum fraction of
the how much any one commodity is satisfied.

Here, we implement Garg's combinatorial MCF algorithm and analyze how various heuristics affect theoretical and
experimental runtime.  We also offer a novel heuristic based on sloppy beta scaling and demonstrate better experimental
runtime.
